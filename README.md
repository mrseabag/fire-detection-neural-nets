# Forest Fire Detection Using YOLOv7 and Detectron2

This project investigates the use of two state-of-the-art object detection models—YOLOv7 and Detectron2—for detecting forest fires in real-time from image and video input.

It compares both models across:
- Accuracy (mAP%)
- Inference Speed (FPS)
- Object and Bounding Box Loss
- Precision and Recall

The study was inspired by Australia's 2020 “Black Summer” and aims to explore how machine learning can assist early wildfire detection to improve climate resilience and emergency response.

This repository contains:
- Training scripts and setup for YOLOv7 and Detectron2
- Example outputs from model inference
- Full extended essay PDF with analysis and results
